# allflac2mp3

## Syntax

    allflac2mp3

This command converts all files with extension `flac` in the current directory
to MP3, using the `flac` and `lame` tools.

Prerequisites:

* flac
* lame

Exact minimum versions are not known. The only requirements are, however, that
`flac` supports the options `-c` (write to stdout) and `-d` (decode â€“ any
version should have this), and that `lame` supports the `--preset standard` option.

## Options

The script has no options.
